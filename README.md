# smartmockups_cli

This is a small script that allows to create mockups via smartmockups.com from the commandline.
In the background the script uses headless chrome (via puppeteer) to login to smartmockups and upload
your design, downloading the mockups.

For usage an active (paid) subscription to smartmockups is needed.
