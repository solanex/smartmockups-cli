# smartmockups_cli

**DEPRECATED**:
- Smartmockups has been sold to canva and the app has been migrated to a canva app.
- See [solanex/mockgen](https://github.com/solanex/mockgen) for a cli mockup generator that works directly on smartmockups/canva template json and assets.

------

This is a small script that allows to create mockups via smartmockups.com from the commandline.
In the background the script uses headless chrome (via puppeteer) to login to smartmockups and upload
your design, downloading the mockups.

For usage an active (paid) subscription to smartmockups is needed.
